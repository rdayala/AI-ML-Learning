FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

Scenario: You are a Data Scientist working for a consulting firm. One of your
colleagues from the Auditing department has asked you to help them assess the financial statement of organisation ABC.

You have been supplied with two vectors/list of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year in question. 

Your task is to calculate the following financial metrics:
- profit for each month
- profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean for the year
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean for the year
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year


All results need to be presented as vectors.
Results for dollar values need to be calculated with $0.01 precision.
Results for the profit margin ratio need to be presented in units of % with no
decimal points.
Note: Your colleague has warned you that it is okay for tax for any given month to be
negative (in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a deferred tax asset).
